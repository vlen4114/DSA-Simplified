## Technical Preparation
### Algorithm Complexity
- Understand Big-O complexity analysis

### Sorting
- Know how to sort using at least one n\*log(n) sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort, merge sort)

### Hash Tables
- Understand how they work and be able to implement one using arrays

### Trees
- Basic tree construction, traversal, and manipulation algorithms
- Familiarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees
- Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS, DFS, and their differences

### Graphs
- Understand different ways to represent a graph (objects and pointers, matrix, adjacency list)
- Know the basic graph traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS
- Study advanced algorithms like Dijkstra and A*

### Other Data Structures
- Study famous classes of NP-complete problems (e.g., traveling salesman, knapsack problem)
- Understand what NP-complete means

### Mathematics
- Refresh knowledge on probability and queueing theory
- Be familiar with n-choose-k problems

### Operating Systems
- Understand processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors, deadlock, livelock, context switching, and scheduling
